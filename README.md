# DROPOUT-ANALYSIS

Participating in the Internal Smart India Hackathon was nothing short of exhilarating. I had the incredible opportunity to be part of a visionary team dedicated to revolutionizing education in India. Together, we crafted a cutting-edge solution that not only identified potential student dropouts but also provided personalized mentorship and direct access to government schemes through a sleek and user-friendly dashboard. Witnessing our innovation lead to tangible results, from a remarkable decrease in dropout rates to students thriving with mentorship and government support, was beyond fulfilling. This experience reaffirmed my unwavering belief in the profound impact of technology and collaborative effort when it comes to transforming our society's most critical challenges.
